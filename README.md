## Project Workflow

The application is designed to provide a seamless experience for security operators, from initial login to real-time threat analysis and response.

1.  **Authentication**: The application begins with a secure login page. Any credentials will grant access, and upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the main dashboard.
2.  **Dashboard Overview**: The core of the application is the dashboard, which presents a comprehensive view of all security zones.
3.  **Live Camera Feeds**: The dashboard displays live video from multiple sources simultaneously:
    *   **Zone A**: Utilizes the local webcam.
    *   **Zone B**: Connects to an IP camera stream.
4.  **AI-Powered Analysis**: Drishti Sentinel leverages a suite of Genkit AI flows for advanced security analysis:
    *   **Anomaly Detection**: Manually trigger a scan on any feed to detect a wide range of anomalies, including fire, unusual crowd behavior, and potential threats.
    *   **Crowd Density**: Analyze headcounts across all zones to assess crowd levels and identify overcrowding risks.
    *   **Face Matching**: Upload a photo to scan for a person of interest specifically within Zone A.
5.  **Alert Management**:
    *   Detected threats generate real-time alerts, which are prioritized by risk level and displayed in the Centralized Alerts Panel.
    *   Critical and high-risk alerts automatically trigger an audible fire alarm sound.
    *   A prominent **SOS** button allows the operator to manually trigger a critical alert across all zones.
6.  **Zone Status**: A detailed table provides an at-a-glance overview of the current status, risk level, and last detected anomaly for each monitored zone.

    ```

### Running the Application

The application requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Genkit development server:**
    Open a terminal and run the following command to start the Genkit flows and watch for changes:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

2.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the frontend application:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) to view the application.
